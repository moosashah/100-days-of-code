### Day 1: October 21, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Setting up/planning for 100 Days of code. Made a Koala using pure CSS

**Thoughts:** This'll be my 4th attempt at 100 days of code.

1. Failed miserably, lasted a few days I think
2. Completed
3. Started learning python because I felt burnt out and wanted to learn something new but then got an Offer for a job so started working
4. Working as a Junior Software engineer, its been almost 2 months, and I want to code outside of work on skills that'll help me for work and in the future.

For now I'm going to be focusing on CSS and move towards bringing designs to life, which I can already do but it takes a lot of time so I guess I want to be more experienced in it so that I'm much muuuuuuuch faster.

### Day 2: October 22, 2021

**Today's Progress:** More CSS practise, made a bear today.

**Thoughts:** Okay so this was completely from scratch whereas the Koala was using a tutorial so it was just following
along to code and ohhh my God was is a frustrating ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥² ...
Anyways I think going forward I'll try to stick to my own ideas and adapting them rather than tryign to find examples
online and then copying their code and trying to adapt that into my code which just wasn't working out for me today. Oh well, it is
what it is. I think repetition will be the best thing for me going forward so I can become more confident. And maybe in a couple weeks
start adding a timer so that I'm not just spending hours making something with pureCSS ðŸ˜… ...
Also need to figure out a script to quickly write this log rather than doing it manually everytime, best part about being a programmer, right? ðŸ¤“

### Day 3: October 23, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Did some vanilla javascript today with Javascript30 by Wes Bos? Drum Kit app

**Thoughts:** The CSS and HTMl was already made but even though we were strictly working on JS and it was a tutorial, I still find it super useful working through things. From this little project I learnt about an event called transitionend which is super useful for triggering stuff like removing a class after the transformation has ended for example. I mean I definitely didn't do anywhere near as much as I would've wanted to but getting in the hour was good enough for me. I also had a really rough start to the day, getting out of bed at 2pm or something which is ridiculous from my normal 7-8am starts ðŸ™ƒ ....
