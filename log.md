### Day 1: October 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Setting up/planning for 100 Days of code. Made a Koala using pure CSS  

**Thoughts:** This'll be my 4th attempt at 100 days of code. 
1. Failed miserably, lasted a few days I think
2. Completed
3. Started learning python because I felt burnt out and wanted to learn something new but then got an Offer for a job so started working
4. Working as a Junior Software engineer, its been almost 2 months, and I want to code outside of work on skills that'll help me for work and in the future.

For now I'm going to be focusing on CSS and move towards bringing designs to life, which I can already do but it takes a lot of time so I guess I want to be more experienced in it so that I'm much muuuuuuuch faster.
